# **Asysis**: Another system information script

Asysis is a lightweight utility program for displaying system information
to a terminal/command-line (i.e. hostname, cpu type, etc). It should be noted that this project is in a very
early stage. I intend on working on this project continually as I make more improvements. Everything in this first commit is just 
a starting point. More patches incoming!
